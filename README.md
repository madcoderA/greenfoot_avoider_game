# Avoider Game

A simple avoider game created with Greenfoot IDE. The idea and base code were taken from the book "Creative Greenfoot". This is a game complete with an introduction screen, game over screen, a score, mouse input, and sound. I've updated the code to the new Greenfoot API (version 3.6.1) and make some changes and additions.

## Story

This is a story about good vs evil. However, good looks evil and evil looks good. The sheer evil of the smiley-faced villians is enought to crack the bones of our skull-faced hero so you must avoid their touch at all cost. Other objects will appear on the screen. Avoid them if they look good.

You score more points the longer you survive the cheery horde.
